I'm 25 years old and I'm from Buenos Aires. I am currently studying Full Stack Web Programming at Digital House.
 
I decided to enter the world of software and digitalization to change my life and the lives of those around me. I firmly believe that evolution is achieved through continuous, agile and autonomous learning using the tools provided by the IT revolution.

I am interested in being part of an organization focused on speed, efficiency and customer satisfaction. But I value even more that they empower skills and offer growth opportunities to their members.
 
My plan is to study Artificial Intelligence at the same pace as technology and, of course, to discover with a team the best and innovative ways to apply it in the daily lives of users.
 
Besides literature, I am fascinated by neural processes. That's why I study Organizational Neuroscience at the National Technological University (UTN). And I would like to investigate the human-machine connection.
 
The biggest challenge I faced (and still face) is the scarcity of economic resources in which I grew up. My conviction, perseverance and determination (coupled with many people who believe in me) have helped me overcome all the obstacles along the way. From the lack of a place to sleep to getting a computer to create my own website.
 
Today I feel ready for a company to exploit all the potential I acquired and have to offer. My time, my skills and my insatiable thirst for knowledge.
 
I direct my career with clear objectives: AI, Neuroscience, Software and Data Science.
 
Working with the best for me, is the next dream to fulfill.
